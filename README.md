# VJ Teaching Utilities
This is a set of "useful" utlities created for my video journalism teaching. Some are specific to the modules I teach and their assessment. Others are a little more generic. These where all generated with some input from AI to create the code. 

Please feel free to use them as you wish. However, I'd really appreciate it if you let me know if you did. I'd be interested in feedback! Let me know at a.dickinson@mmu.ac.uk

-- ScriptBuilder.html - a stand alone webpage that allows a student to visually build formatted script from blocks of content. This was developed for a first-year module, Media Making for Journalists, where the assessment required them to build a simple package to a preset template (hence the basic structure). It works out basic timings and forces the student to include shot descriptions, nat sound information and lower-third information on interviews. It also allows for a basic cutaway in an the interview.
