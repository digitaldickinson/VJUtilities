# VJUtilities
This is a set of "useful" utlities created for my video journalism teaching. Some are specific to the modules I teach and their assessment. Others are a little more generic. These where all generated with some input from AI to create the code. 
Please feel free to use them as you wish. However, I'd really appreciate it if you let me know if you did. I'd be interested in feedback! Let me know at a.dickinson@mmu.ac.uk
